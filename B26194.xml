            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>LONDONS LOYALTY TO THEIR <hi>King and Countrey,</hi> AND THE PROTESTANT RELIGION,</head>
            <p>THere being a Scandalous Pamphlet Published on <hi>Monday September</hi> the Eight last past, Called the <hi>English Courant,</hi> wherein it was Expressed, That <hi>On Thursday last, the City of</hi> London <hi>Deputed Sir</hi> George Jefferies <hi>to go to</hi> Windsor, <hi>to Complement the Duke of</hi> York <hi>upon his safe Arrival:</hi> Which was no sooner Published in the City, but the Citizens (to Manifest their Abhorrency of so False and Scandalous a thing) went a Considerable Number of them Immediately to the Lord Mayor, then with the Aldermen in the <hi>Guildhall;</hi> where they not onely Complained of the Notorious Injury and Affront done to the City by that Forgery, but further Declared, That though in truth, whilst the Duke of <hi>York</hi> seemed to come into <hi>England</hi> onely as a Visitor, they did not much Concern them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with his Return; Yet now since it rather appears, he came with a Resolution to stay, they apprehended Themselves and the Nation in great Danger thereby: and therefore desired his Lordship forthwith to call a Lieutenancy, and to Double the City Guards. To all which his Lordship answered to this
<pb facs="tcp:186065:2"/>Purpose, <hi>viz.</hi> That he had already sent for the Printer, and that He and his Brethren were considering how to Punish him according to his Demerit; and that he had already Ordered the Lieutenancy to meet on <hi>Wednesday</hi> next, in Order to the Doubling the City Guards. And his Lordship was then further pleased to free himself from an Aspersion cast upon him, that he should declare to Sir <hi>George Jefferies, That if the King should Dye, he would Immediately Proclaim the Duke of</hi> York <hi>King:</hi> His Lordship protesting he never said any such thing, and desired the said Citizens to acquaint their Fellow-Citizens therewith.</p>
            <p>This is a True Account of this Transaction, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if any other Relation be made thereof, it is to be looked upon as False; and the Reader is desired to Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept hereof, till the Ingenuous and Hearty Speech of that Worthy Knight and True <hi>English</hi> Man, Sir <hi>Thomas Player,</hi> be Published at Large, which it is great Pity the World should want.</p>
